# plotly-agent

This is a basic experiment of an AI agent that creates Plotly.js plots and updates them by user requests.

It is supposed to use Plotly's JSON schema for validation, but this part does not work correctly yet.

It was created in a conversation with `o3-mini-high` with some manual corrections. Implemented in Clojure.

## Usage

```bash
clojure -M -m plotly.agent
```

Then browse `http://localhost:3000`.
